# TODO List for Image Fit Fix

- [x] Analyze the events page and globals.css for image display issues
- [x] Identify missing CSS classes for object-fit
- [x] Add .object-fit-cover and .object-cover classes to globals.css with object-fit: cover (to crop excess parts to fit frame)
- [x] Test the changes by running the development server and checking the events page
